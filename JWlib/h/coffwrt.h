/*note before you use this for anything make sure that the values below
are large enough for your purposes (particularly the num sections and symbols.
I put in some saftey code in the string table because if the user declares
long function names (very long like > 512) it is possible that 1k will not
suffice for the string table size in import libraries.  the number of sections
and symbols however are fixed and suffice for import libraries  */
